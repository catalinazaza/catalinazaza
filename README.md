# ğŸŒ»About me 
I am an ArgentinianğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡· political scientist pursuing a _Master in International Affairs_ at [John Cabot University](https://www.johncabot.edu/master-international-affairs/default.aspx) in Rome. 
I have experience in project management and data analytics for projects in both the public and private sectors. I believe that data science is a powerful tool to complement public policies and the development of projects with social and economic impact.  

Here you can find some of the repositories I have worked on and am currently developing, which I am very proud of!
